# React Media Voting App

This is a React-based web application that allows users to view and vote on various media items, such as audio and video content. The application has two main views: an Admin Panel and a Voting Panel. This project was bootstrapped with Vite.

## Features

1. **Admin Panel**:
   - Administrators can view a list of all media items, including their thumbnails, URLs, and associated tags.
   - Administrators can add new tags to individual media items.

2. **Voting Panel**:
   - Users can view a list of all media items, including their thumbnails, URLs, associated tags, and the number of votes.
   - Users can vote for their favorite media items.

3. **User Authentication**:
   - The application supports two types of users: administrators and regular voters.
   - Administrators can access the Admin Panel, while regular users can only access the Voting Panel.
   - Users can switch between the admin and voter views using a toggle button.

## How to Use
